## Current Review
- Verified the active repository is `claw-webchat` at `/Users/memphis/.openclaw/workspace-mira/claw-webchat`.
- Verified `main` is the only development baseline; local `HEAD` and `origin/main` both point to `f4c8bd8`
  (`docs: record shared dev repo bootstrap`), while `ee656ce` is no longer the latest pushed commit.
- Reconfirmed the naming rule: user-facing branding should stay `Claw WebChat`, but backend technical
  identifiers intentionally remain `openclaw-webchat`, including `/api/openclaw-webchat/*`,
  `OPENCLAW_WEBCHAT_*`, and namespace/service identifiers.
- Current shipped baseline remains `0.1.6` with history search phase-2 first batch, session-scoped
  `/model` picker, session-scoped `T:*` thinking menu, send/stop dual-state composer, tightened media
  fallback bootstrap, desktop media `70vw` cap, and stabilized right-pane scrolling.
- The next unresolved priorities still match the latest handoff: mobile history loading stability,
  visual media bubble/manual comparison, broader multi-agent late-reply regression, audio transcription
  success-path validation, and the next round of history-search polish.
- The local `media/` directory is now ignored through `.git/info/exclude`, so it stays in the worktree
  without becoming a repo-tracked or GitHub-synced path.
- The thinking button follow-up now avoids blocking `openAgent(...)`: session switching no longer waits for
  the thinking-options request before rendering the conversation, the composer button has been simplified
  back to a static `T`, and the active session's model / thinking state is shown beside the header title.
- The header-side thinking state now uses the full level name (for example `off`, `minimal`, `medium`)
  instead of the abbreviated `T:*` label form.
- Verification passed for this UI follow-up with `npm run check` and `npm run selftest`.
- Root cause of the Wangyuyan history jump was confirmed before the fix: background polling could reopen the
  current conversation after agent summary/presence changes, but that reload path only knew how to preserve
  pinned-bottom behavior and did not preserve the user's non-bottom reading position.
- The conversation pane now distinguishes bottom-following vs history-reading states, keeps a visible-message
  anchor across current-conversation re-renders, defers background conversation refresh into an explicit
  notice while the user is reading history, and adds `Home` / `End` / `PageUp` / `PageDown` navigation.
- Verification for the conversation-pane follow-up passed with `npm run check` and `npm run selftest`.
- Wangyuyan mp3 send regression is not caused by frontend audio rendering: history already contains a prior successful
  mp3 attachment reply, and both the server and `public/message-blocks.js` still classify `.mp3` as `audio`.
- The latest Wangyuyan reply instead shows an agent-compliance failure: it generated a local mp3 file path but claimed
  WebChat could not receive it, which points back to the hidden media fallback contract not being explicit enough for
  locally generated audio outputs such as TTS results.
- The hidden bootstrap now explicitly names generated local `.mp3` / `.wav` output and tells agents to return it with
  `MEDIA:` / `mediaUrl:` instead of claiming Claw WebChat cannot receive the file; `BOOTSTRAP_VERSION` was bumped so
  existing sessions will re-ingest that stricter rule on their next open/send path.
- Verification passed for the mp3 follow-up with `npm run check` and `npm run selftest`.
- The local LaunchAgent service was restarted successfully and `http://127.0.0.1:3770/healthz` returned `{ "ok": true }`;
  Wangyuyan's binding remains on the older bootstrap until the next user turn triggers reinjection.
- The next requested follow-up is to first sync the current mainline state to GitHub, then branch off and implement
  an event-driven refresh path in place of the fixed 10-second polling model.

## Review
- Read `status.md`, `docs/HANDOFF-2026-03-24.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`,
  `docs/error.md`, `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md`, `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md`,
  `README.md`, and `package.json`.
- Current baseline is `main` at `0.1.6`; user-visible branding is `Claw WebChat`, while backend
  technical identifiers intentionally remain `openclaw-webchat`.
- Current architecture remains a lightweight Node/Express adapter plus static frontend, with local
  JSONL history, per-agent session binding, media proxy/signing, and a narrow OpenClaw gateway
  integration surface.
- The main unresolved product risks are still mobile history loading stability, media bubble/manual
  visual regression, multi-agent late-reply regression coverage, audio transcription success-path
  validation, and the next batch of history-search polish.
- Athena image-send investigation:
  - `main`/Athena has the current bootstrap marker in `data/session-bindings.json`
    (`bootstrapVersion: 2026-03-16.phase2`), so this was not a missing-bootstrap case.
  - Raw upstream history shows Athena (`gpt-5.4`) generated the image successfully, then tried the
    `message` tool with `channel: "webchat"` and got `Unknown channel: webchat`, after which it
    told the user it could not send the image.
  - A successful Baichai case shows the model returning a plain text reply ending with
    `MEDIA:/absolute/path.png`, which WebChat parses into an image block.
  - Current hidden bootstrap explains `MEDIA:` / `mediaUrl:` fallback, but it is not explicit
    enough to steer Athena away from an unsupported `message` tool path.
- Media protocol follow-up:
  - Refreshed `BOOTSTRAP_VERSION` to `2026-03-24.media-v1` so existing sessions can pick up the
    tighter media contract on the next open/send after version mismatch.
  - Shortened the bootstrap text while making the contract stricter: local files and direct
    remote `http/https` media URLs should use the `MEDIA:` / `mediaUrl:` fallback, and agents are
    told not to use the unsupported `message` tool / `webchat` channel path.
  - Added selftest coverage for both local-path and remote-URL fallback directives, plus a static
    assertion that the bootstrap contract keeps the new media guidance.
  - Verification passed: `npm run check`, `npm run selftest`.
  - Synced to GitHub on `main` with commit `59aa488` (`fix: tighten webchat media bootstrap`).
- Wangyuyan news-brief image sizing investigation:
  - The reproduced message is the long March 24 news brief with alternating text/image blocks in
    a single assistant message.
  - That message does not enter the `visual-media-bubble` branch because
    `shouldUseVisualMediaBubble(...)` falls back to a regular bubble whenever total text length is
    greater than `220`.
  - In the regular bubble branch, images and video are globally capped at `max-width: min(420px, 100%)`,
    so large remote news images from BBC/MS NOW are intentionally shrunk on desktop.
- 70vw experiment setup:
  - Created branch `codex/desktop-media-70vw`.
  - In the regular media branch only, desktop/default image and video max-width was changed from
    `min(420px, 100%)` to `min(70vw, 100%)` for visual comparison, without changing the
    `visual-media-bubble` decision logic.
  - Verification passed: `npm run check`.
- Mixed-media bubble rollback:
  - The follow-up experiment that forced all text+media messages into visual-media bubbles was
    reverted at the user's request.
  - The branch is now back to the previous experiment state: keep the desktop/default `70vw`
    media cap experiment, but preserve the original mixed-media bubble gating behavior.
- Right-side scroll jump diagnosis:
  - Primary cause 1: `loadOlderHistory()` restores scroll position with
    `nextHeight - previousHeight` only, but does not add the pre-load `scrollTop`, so prepending
    history near the top shifts the viewport and produces a visible jump.
  - Primary cause 2: `shouldKeepConversationPinnedAfterRender()` returns `true` whenever the active
    session is busy, so any render while the agent is processing can force a bottom re-scroll even
    after the user has manually scrolled away from the bottom.
  - Secondary risk: the message list uses `scroll-behavior: smooth`, while code paths also use
    `scrollIntoView(...)`, `scrollTo(...)`, and direct `scrollTop` reassignment; these animation
    modes can overlap and make jumps feel more dramatic.
  - Secondary risk: polling refresh can force `openAgent(... forceReload: true, preserveScrollBottom: true)`
    for the current conversation, which rebuilds the message DOM without preserving the user's
    current non-bottom scroll offset.
- Right-side scroll jump fix:
  - `loadOlderHistory()` now captures the pre-load `scrollTop` and restores the viewport with
    `previousTop + (nextHeight - previousHeight)`, so prepending older history keeps the user's
    current visible content stable.
  - `shouldKeepConversationPinnedAfterRender()` now respects only `state.autoScrollPinned`, so a
    busy agent no longer overrides a deliberate manual scroll-away from the bottom.
  - `.message-list` now uses `scroll-behavior: auto`, which removes overlapping smooth-scroll
    animations from manual scroll, prepended-history restoration, and explicit bottom sync calls.
  - Static selftest coverage now checks the preserved scroll-offset formula, the tightened
    auto-pin condition, and the direct scroll behavior.
  - Verification passed: `npm run check`, `npm run selftest`, LaunchAgent restart, and
    `http://127.0.0.1:3770/healthz`.
- Mainline merge follow-up:
  - Fast-forward merged `codex/desktop-media-70vw` into `main`, so the `70vw` desktop media cap
    change and the right-side scroll stabilization are now the official development baseline.
  - Updated `CHANGELOG.md`, `status.md`, and `docs/HANDOFF-2026-03-24.md` to remove the old
    “experimental branch only” wording and mark `main` as the branch to continue from.
- Thinking picker follow-up:
  - Added a dedicated `T` button to the right side of the composer, next to the existing slash and
    send controls, so users can change the current agent session's thinking level without typing
    `/think` manually.
  - The composer button label is now dynamic and reflects the current session thinking level as
    `T:Off`, `T:Min`, `T:L`, `T:M`, `T:H`, `T:X`, or `T:Ada` when available; binary providers also
    preserve `T:On` when the current model only exposes `off/on`.
  - Added session-scoped `GET /api/openclaw-webchat/sessions/:sessionKey/thinking-options` and
    `PATCH /api/openclaw-webchat/sessions/:sessionKey/thinking` endpoints, which reuse the current
    upstream session state and avoid polluting chat history with UI-only configuration changes.
  - The thinking menu is model-aware: it shows the current session model label plus the normalized
    thinking options for that model, including binary `off/on` providers and `xhigh`-capable
    models.
  - Verification passed: `npm run check`, LaunchAgent restart, `http://127.0.0.1:3770/healthz`,
    and `npm run selftest`.
- `/model` completeness + responsiveness follow-up:
  - Direct upstream probing confirmed that OpenClaw `models.list` already included `gpt-5.4`, so
    the missing-model complaint was not caused by the upstream runtime dropping that model.
  - The main latency cause was local: every `/model` open in Claw WebChat shelled out to the
    OpenClaw CLI twice (`sessions.list` + `models.list`) with no cache, which made the picker
    materially slower than the native OpenClaw Web UI.
  - Added short-lived in-memory caches for `models.list` and `sessions.list`, with automatic
    session-cache invalidation after `sessions.patch`, `sessions.reset`, and `sessions.compact`.
  - The model picker now reuses the most recent session payload for an instant reopen and silently
    refreshes only when that cached payload has gone stale.
  - `/model` list output was changed from a fixed top-10 truncation to a provider-grouped full
    summary, which keeps token usage compact while ensuring models like `gpt-5.4` are not hidden.
  - Follow-up reproduction across Athena and other agents showed that the data layer always still
    contained `gpt-5.4`; the remaining completeness issue was in the modal layout, where the
    model-picker card used a capped grid container without reserving a `1fr` row for the scroll
    region, so bottom options could be visually clipped instead of scrolling.
  - Fixed the picker layout by reserving the last grid row as `minmax(0, 1fr)` and constraining
    `.model-picker-list` to its own scroll box, so the last models remain reachable regardless of
    current model choice, viewport height, or browser zoom.
  - Verification passed: `npm run check`, LaunchAgent restart, `npm run selftest`, live `/model`
    response inspection showing `gpt-5.4`, and live `/model-options` timings improving from about
    `2533.8ms` on the first cold request to about `0.5–1.2ms` on warm repeats.
- Thinking menu follow-up:
  - Mirrored the model-picker warm-reopen pattern onto the `T` menu with a short-lived client-side
    cache for the current session’s thinking payload, so repeated opens do not blank the menu and
    wait for a network round-trip when the session/model has not changed.
  - Successful thinking-level changes now keep the menu open and show a visible success notice
    inside the menu, instead of closing immediately after the PATCH succeeds.
  - Existing background refresh hooks for `/think`, `/model`, `/new`, `/reset`, and model-button
    switches are preserved, so the cached menu payload stays aligned with upstream session state.
- `/model` picker copy follow-up:
  - The modal previously showed the same introductory sentence twice while idle: once in the fixed
    header copy and once again in the lower status/message area.
  - `renderModelPicker()` now leaves the lower message area empty when there is no loading state,
    success notice, warning, or error to show, so the top explanatory copy remains the only intro.
  - Synced the follow-up into `CHANGELOG.md`, `status.md`, and `docs/HANDOFF-2026-03-24.md`.
  - Verification passed: `npm run check`.
  - Synced to GitHub on `main` with commit `40e80e0` (`fix: remove duplicate model picker copy`).
- Public install-doc completeness follow-up:
  - Audited the public release path against the required two install methods: downloaded release
    bundle and network-based installation.
  - Tightened `docs/AGENT_INSTALL_BUNDLE.md` so the bundle path explicitly bounces missing
    Node/OpenClaw prerequisites to the network bootstrap path before returning.
  - Tightened `docs/AGENT_INSTALL_NETWORK.md` so it now covers official OpenClaw bootstrap and
    onboarding before downloading WebChat, keeps the one-step/one-check discipline, and avoids a
    hard `git` dependency by using tarball downloads for both release and `main`.
  - Updated `README.md`, `docs/PUBLIC_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `status.md` so
    the public repo now states this install-doc standard explicitly.
  - Verification passed: `npm run check`.
  - Synced to GitHub on `main` with commit `dfa3089` (`docs: tighten public install guides`).
- First public GitHub Release follow-up:
  - Built the release bundle with `npm run bundle`, producing `dist/claw-webchat-v0.1.6-bundle.tar.gz`
    and `dist/claw-webchat-v0.1.6-bundle.sha256`.
  - Verified the archive root layout and confirmed the bundle contains `package.json`, `src/`,
    `public/`, `docs/`, and `scripts/`.
  - Published the first non-draft GitHub Release as `v0.1.6`, targeting commit `be4be55`, with
    both downloadable assets attached.
  - Release URL: `https://github.com/memphislee09-source/claw-webchat/releases/tag/v0.1.6`
  - Bundle download URL:
    `https://github.com/memphislee09-source/claw-webchat/releases/download/v0.1.6/claw-webchat-v0.1.6-bundle.tar.gz`
  - Checksum download URL:
    `https://github.com/memphislee09-source/claw-webchat/releases/download/v0.1.6/claw-webchat-v0.1.6-bundle.sha256`
- Promo video v3 follow-up:
  - Re-generated the voiceover as per-scene `scenes-v4` clips so each visual section now tracks its own
    narration instead of relying on one long track with hand-estimated cut points.
  - Updated the rich-media section to use `08-markdown.png` and changed the media copy from `文件` to
    `Markdown文件`.
  - Tightened the full composition from `1309` frames to `1019` frames and looped the background bed so the
    shorter new narration still ends cleanly.
  - Re-rendered the promo video as `media/video/remotion-promo/out/claw-webchat-promo-v3.mp4` and
    concatenated the new voice track as `media/audio/claw-webchat-promo-zh-v3.mp3`.
  - Verification passed:
    `ffprobe` confirms `1920x1080`, duration `34.026667s`, size about `7.8MB`.
  - Visual spot checks passed:
    `20s` frame stays on the history/search scene, `23s` frame enters rich-media, and `29s` frame shows the
    model + Think controls scene.
- Promo video v4 CTA restore:
  - Split the old final control narration into a dedicated control clip and a dedicated CTA clip, then
    reintroduced `OutroScene` as the final sequence so the last line has its own visual landing page.
  - Moved all promo audio references to `scenes-v5`, keeping scenes `01-05` unchanged and regenerating
    only scenes `06-07` for the fixed ending.
  - Re-rendered the promo video as `media/video/remotion-promo/out/claw-webchat-promo-v4.mp4` and
    concatenated the new voice track as `media/audio/claw-webchat-promo-zh-v4.mp3`.
  - Verification passed:
    `ffprobe` confirms `1920x1080`, duration `39.914667s`, size about `8.6MB`.
  - Tail-frame spot checks passed:
    `34s`, `37s`, and `39s` all land on the dedicated CTA outro instead of the preceding control scene.
- README demo-video swap:
  - Replaced the old four-image `Screenshots` section in `README.md` with a `Demo Video` section that
    points directly at the tracked promo video artifact.
  - Added `docs/media/claw-webchat-promo-v4.mp4` as the repository-stable path for the current promo cut.
  - Verification passed:
    `README.md` no longer references `docs/images/main-ui.png`, `docs/images/model-picker.png`,
    `docs/images/history-search.png`, or `docs/images/settings.png`.
  - Artifact verification passed:
    `ffprobe` confirms `docs/media/claw-webchat-promo-v4.mp4` is `1920x1080`, duration `39.914667s`,
    size about `9.0MB`.
- README homepage embed follow-up:
  - Replaced the local-repo video link as the primary demo surface with the provided
    `github.com/user-attachments/assets/...` URL so the promo video can render directly on the GitHub
    repository homepage.
  - Kept the tracked repository copy as a secondary download link under the embedded video.
  - Synced to GitHub on `main` with commit `d10de51` (`docs: embed promo video on repo homepage`).
- README bilingual homepage follow-up:
  - Reworked `README.md` into a bilingual landing page with a shared top-level video area and explicit
    language-switch links: `简体中文` and `English`.
  - Added stable in-page anchors `#zh-cn` and `#en` so users can jump between the two language sections
    with one click from the GitHub repository homepage.
  - Mirrored the public-facing project overview, installation paths, quick start, capability summary,
    security notes, and docs navigation in both Chinese and English.
  - Synced to GitHub on `main` with commit `6ec7c14` (`docs: add bilingual repo homepage`).
- Tools docs follow-up:
  - Added `tools/README.md` as the entry point for reusable tool-operation guides.
  - Added `tools/VIDEO_PROMO_WORKFLOW.md` to capture the full narrated promo-video workflow, including
    script prep, screenshot collection, SiliconFlow CosyVoice scene-based TTS, Remotion rendering,
    FFmpeg verification, and GitHub README embedding.
  - Verified the documented reference paths exist for the current project state:
    `docs/media/claw-webchat-promo-v4.mp4`,
    `media/video/remotion-promo/src/PromoVideo.tsx`,
    `media/video/remotion-promo/src/Root.tsx`,
    and `media/video/source-shots/`.
  - Synced to GitHub on `main` with commit `e2b51df` (`docs: add tools video workflow guide`).
- Tools docs relocation follow-up:
  - Moved the entire repo-local `tools/` folder to the shared archive path:
    `/Users/memphis/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/dev/codex-docs/claw-webchat/tools/`
  - Kept the original `tools/` structure in the archive so future reusable docs can continue to live
    there without being tied to the project repository.
  - Removed the repo-local `tools/` directory from `main` and synced the cleanup on commit `6818771`
    (`docs: move shared tools docs out of repo`).
- Shared `dev` repo bootstrap:
  - Created the private GitHub repo `memphis-dev-docs` for the entire shared iCloud dev archive.
  - Initialized `/Users/memphis/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/dev` as a standalone git
    repository on branch `main`, with remote:
    `https://github.com/memphislee09-source/memphis-dev-docs.git`
  - Added a root `README.md` plus `.gitignore`, then pushed the initial baseline.
  - Added a workflow note in the dev repo root README that any edits under the `dev` directory should be
    followed by `git add -A`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
  - Verified the new repo is private, tracks `origin/main`, and currently has clean git status after sync.
