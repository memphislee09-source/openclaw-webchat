# openclaw-webchat

A standalone WebChat for OpenClaw with long-lived per-agent history, local media handling, and a lightweight server adapter.

`openclaw-webchat` 是一个独立于 OpenClaw 默认 WebUI 的 WebChat 项目，目标是在不深度耦合官方前端实现的前提下，提供更稳定的历史保留、富媒体体验和多会话隔离能力。

## Status
- Current version: `0.1.4`
- Stability: `alpha`
- Default branch: `main`
- Recommended deployment: local machine or private network behind Tailscale / equivalent access control
- Current priorities:
  - verify mobile history loading stability and fix the root cause if needed
  - continue visual media bubble regression checks
  - run broader multi-agent / late-reply regression
  - validate the successful audio transcription path
  - ship history search phase 2

## What This Project Does
- Keeps a long-lived timeline for each OpenClaw agent inside the `openclaw-webchat` namespace
- Stores displayable history locally in JSONL instead of depending on upstream internal logs for rendering
- Supports assistant rich media rendering for images, audio, video, and files
- Supports user image upload and audio upload with optional local Whisper transcription
- Preserves local history across `/new` while resetting only the upstream context
- Provides a dedicated web UI with agent list, search, settings, avatars, and responsive layout
- Adds local slash command handling for common session and model operations

## Scope And Non-Goals
`openclaw-webchat` is intentionally scoped as a focused companion UI for OpenClaw.

Current non-goals:
- sync history with the default OpenClaw WebUI
- sync history with Slack, Discord, or other external channels
- expose a public-internet, multi-tenant hosted SaaS deployment
- add a built-in authentication system for the MVP
- publish this repo as an npm package

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js `20+`
- A working `openclaw` CLI available on `PATH`
- A local OpenClaw environment that can answer CLI requests

### Run Locally
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The service listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3770` by default.

### Runtime Configuration

Useful environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENCLAW_WEBCHAT_PORT` | `3770` | HTTP port |
| `OPENCLAW_WEBCHAT_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. Set `0.0.0.0` for LAN access if you understand the trust boundary. |
| `OPENCLAW_BIN` | `openclaw` | Path to the OpenClaw CLI |
| `OPENCLAW_WEBCHAT_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Runtime data directory |
| `OPENCLAW_WEBCHAT_MEDIA_SECRET` | auto-generated | Media token signing secret |
| `OPENCLAW_WEBCHAT_LAUNCHD_LABEL` | `ai.openclaw.webchat` | launchd label used by the in-app restart action on macOS |
| `OPENCLAW_WEBCHAT_GITHUB_URL` | project repo URL | GitHub link shown in the settings "About" panel |

### Access Modes
- Local browser on the same machine: works out of the box with the default loopback bind
- LAN browser access: supported by switching the access mode to LAN in the settings UI and then restarting the service
- Tailscale access: supported when your Tailnet can already reach this machine; the app itself does not require a separate Tailscale integration layer

The settings UI now includes:
- an Appearance section for theme presets
- an interface language switch with Simplified Chinese and English
- access mode switching between local-only and LAN / Tailscale-friendly binding
- optional light authentication for shared LAN-style access
- an About section with project summary and GitHub link
- a Manual Start section with install, start, and restart command hints
- a reminder when a service restart is required for access-mode changes
- an in-app restart action for launchd-managed macOS setups, plus a manual restart command hint
- a note that document access scope follows the current OpenClaw configuration instead of a separate WebChat-only restriction

Basic health check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3770/healthz
```

For a macOS background service workflow, this repo includes an example launch script:

```bash
scripts/run-webchat-launchd.sh
```

This script is a project-local example, not a universal installer.

## Security And Deployment Notes
- This project is designed first for local or private-network use.
- It does not ship with a built-in auth layer for public internet exposure.
- Document access scope follows the current OpenClaw configuration.
- Local media rendering follows OpenClaw/runtime output plus the current instance auth boundary rather than a separate WebChat-only document/media restriction.
- LAN access is supported, but it is an explicit operator choice. Prefer the default loopback bind unless you intentionally need access from other devices.
- If you use LAN mode, you can optionally enable a lightweight shared password from the settings panel.
- Listener rebinding is not hot-swapped inside the current Node process, so switching between local-only and LAN bind modes still requires a service restart.
- Before exposing it beyond your own machine or private mesh, read [docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development Checks
```bash
npm run check
```

Optional local integration smoke test:

```bash
npm run selftest
```

`selftest` assumes you already have a usable local OpenClaw environment. CI does not rely on that external dependency.

## Current Highlights
- Dedicated API namespace: `/api/openclaw-webchat/*`
- Stable `agentId -> session` binding
- Local JSONL history with visible-only messages
- Rich media parsing with structured blocks plus `MEDIA:` / `mediaUrl:` fallbacks
- Search within the current agent timeline with jump-to-hit and keyword highlight
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile drawer navigation
- User and agent avatar/profile customization
- Theme presets and lighter chat-bubble visual treatment
- Retry and timeout handling for gateway and long-running assistant responses

## Contribution And Release Expectations
- Update relevant docs before or alongside code changes.
- Keep changes small, reviewable, and easy to roll back.
- Run the documented checks before opening a pull request.
- Treat `main` as the release baseline. Experimental branches should stay isolated until explicitly approved for merge.
